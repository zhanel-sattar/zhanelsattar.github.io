	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>
	The settlement in the area of current Shymkent existed at the edge of 11th-12th centuries. 
     There is a hypothesis about earlier formation of Shymkent.The idea is based on archaeological excavations in which some burial places were found and specialists refer them to 5th-6th centuries.</p>

	<p>
	For centuries Shymkent settlement was devastated by aggressive invaders. In early 13th century Genghis Khan’s army went through Sairamsky oasis which became a part of the territory belonging to the conqueror’s descendants. In the 14th century, Timur included it into his state as a result of successful military actions against Ak Horde and Golden Horde khans.

	In the early 16th century, Shymkent became part of Kazakh khanate, later within the 17th-18th centuries it was invaded by Dzhungar conquerors. In spite of numerous wars badly affecting the population Sairamsky oasis remained a region of developed agriculture, gardening and handicrafts.

	At the end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century, Kokand and Bukhara khanates struggled for possessing Shymkent. In 1810-1864s, the town was a military camp-fortress ruled by Kokand with a numerous army and a khan deputy’s residence.

    In 1864, Shymkent was successfully attacked by Russian army and became an important transit point linking European part of Russia and Western Siberia with Middle Asia. In 1914, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s joining Russian Empire, the city was named after Russian general Chernyaeyv, but in 1924 its ex-name was returned to the city.
